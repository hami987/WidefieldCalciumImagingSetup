# Getting Started with GitHub Desktop

This guide will help you set up and use **GitHub Desktop** to work with the calcium imaging setup repository without needing Git command line knowledge.

---

## 1. Install GitHub Desktop
- Download from: [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)  
- Install it like a normal application.

---

## 2. Sign in
1. Open GitHub Desktop.  
2. Go to **File → Options → Accounts**.  
3. Sign in with your GitHub account (you may need to create one if you don’t have one).  

---

## 3. Clone the Repository
1. In GitHub Desktop, click **File → Clone Repository**.  
2. Switch to the **URL** tab.  
3. Paste the repository link (e.g. `https://github.com/ORGNAME/calcium-imaging-setup.git`).  
4. Choose a folder on your computer where the files will be stored.  
5. Click **Clone**.

---

## 4. Make Changes
1. Open the repo folder in your favorite editor (VS Code, Arduino IDE, etc.).  
2. Edit files (e.g., update documentation, add new Python scripts, etc.).  
3. Return to GitHub Desktop — it will automatically detect your changes.  

---

## 5. Commit Changes
1. In GitHub Desktop, review the list of changed files.  
2. Write a short **summary** of your change (e.g., “Added wiring diagram to docs”).  
3. Click **Commit to main**.  

---

## 6. Push Changes to GitHub
- After committing, click **Push origin** (top bar).  
- Your changes are now live in the GitHub repository.  

---

## 7. Pull Updates
- If someone else has updated the repository, click **Fetch origin** and then **Pull origin** to get the newest version.

---

## 8. Typical Workflow
1. **Fetch origin** to make sure you’re up to date.  
2. Make your changes locally.  
3. **Commit to main** with a clear description.  
4. **Push origin** to send your changes to GitHub.  

---

## 9. Troubleshooting
- If you see conflicts when pulling:
  - Ask a colleague for help — conflicts mean two people changed the same file in different ways.  
  - GitHub Desktop will guide you through resolving them.  

---

## 10. Additional Resources
- GitHub Desktop docs: [https://docs.github.com/en/desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop)  
- Intro video: [https://youtu.be/8Dd7KRpKeaE](https://youtu.be/8Dd7KRpKeaE)
